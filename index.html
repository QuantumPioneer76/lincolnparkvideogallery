                    Lyrics: <br>
                    <br>
                    It starts with one thing <br>
                    I don't know why <br>
                    It doesn't even matter how hard you try <br>
                    Keep that in mind <br>
                    I designed this rhyme <br>
                    To explain in due time <br>
                    All I know <br>
                    Time is a valuable thing <br>
                    Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings <br>
                    Watch it count down to the end of the day <br>
                    The clock ticks life away <br>
                    <br>
                    It's so unreal <br>
                    Didn't look out below <br>
                    Watch the time go right out the window <br>
                    Trying to hold on, didn't even know <br>
                    I wasted it all just to watch you go <br>
                    I kept everything inside <br>
                    And even though I tried, it all fell apart <br>
                    What it meant to me <br>
                    <br>
                    Will eventually be a memory of a time when <br>
                    I tried so hard <br>
                    And got so far <br>
                    But in the end <br>
                    It doesn't even matter <br>
                    I had to fall <br>
                    To lose it all <br>
                    But in the end <br>
                    It doesn't even matter <br>
                    <br>
                    One thing, I don't know why <br>
                    It doesn't even matter how hard you try <br>
                    Keep that in mind <br>
                    I designed this rhyme <br>
                    To remind myself how <br>
                    I tried so hard <br>
                    In spite of the way you were mocking me <br>
                    Acting like I was part of your property <br>
                    Remembering all the times you fought with me <br>
                    I'm surprised it got so <br>
                    Things aren't the way they were before <br>
                    You wouldn't even recognize me anymore <br>
                    Not that you knew me back then <br>
                    But it all comes back to me in the end <br>
                    You kept everything inside <br>
                    And even though I tried, it all fell apart <br>
                    What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when <br>
                    <br>
                    I tried so hard <br>
                    And got so far <br>
                    But in the end <br>
                    It doesn't even matter <br>
                    I had to fall <br>
                    To lose it all <br>
                    But in the end <br>
                    It doesn't even matter <br>
                    <br>
                    I've put my trust in you <br>
                    Pushed as far as I can go <br>
                    For all this <br>
                    There's only one thing you should know <br>
                    I've put my trust in you <br>
                    Pushed as far as I can go <br>
                    For all this <br>
                    There's only one thing you should know <br>
                    <br>
                    I tried so hard <br>
                    And got so far <br>

                    <br>
                    Take me down to the river bend <br>
                    Take me down to the fighting end <br>
                    Wash the poison from off my skin <br>
                    Show me how to be whole again <br>
                    Fly me up on a silver wing <br>
                    Past the black where the sirens sing <br>
                    Warm me up in a nova's glow <br>
                    And drop me down to the dream below <br>
                    <br>
                    'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass <br>
                    Hardly anything there for you to see <br>
                    For you to see <br>
                    <br>
                    Bring me home in a blinding dream <br>
                    Through the secrets that I have seen <br>
                    Wash the sorrow from off my skin <br>
                    And show me how to be whole again <br>
                    <br>
                    'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass <br>

                    In this farewell <br>

                    <br>
                    Put to rest what you thought of me<br>
                    While I clean this slate<br>
                    With the hands of uncertainty<br>
                    So let mercy come and wash away<br>

                    Today this ends<br>
                    I'm forgiving<br>

                    Lyrics:<br>
                    <br>
                    Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time<br>
                    Hand grenade pins in every line<br>
                    Throw 'em up and let something shine<br>
                    Going out of my fucking mind<br>
                    <br>
                    Filthy mouth, no excuse<br>
                    Find a new place to hang this noose<br>
                    String me up from atop these roofs<br>
                    Knot it tight so I won't get loose<br>
                    <br>
                    Truth is, you can stop and stare<br>
                    Bled myself out and no one cares<br>
                    Dug a trench out, laid down there<br>
                    With a shovel up out of reach somewhere<br>
                    <br>
                    Yeah, someone pour it in<br>
                    Make it a dirt dance floor again<br>
                    Say your prayers and stomp it out<br>
                    When they bring that chorus in<br>
                    <br>
                    I bleed it out<br>
                    Digging deeper just to throw it away<br>
                    I bleed it out<br>
                    Digging deeper just to throw it away<br>
                    I bleed it out<br>
                    Digging deeper just to throw it away<br>
                    Just to throw it away<br>
                    Just to throw it away<br>
                    <br>
                    I bleed it out<br>
                    Go, stop the show<br>
                    Choppy words in a sloppy flow<br>
                    Shotgun opera, lock and load<br>
                    <br>
                    Cock it back and then watch it go<br>
                    Mama, help me, I've been cursed<br>
                    Death is rolling in every verse<br>
                    Candy paint on his brand new hearse<br>
                    <br>
                    Can't contain him<br>
                    He knows he works<br>
                    Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie<br>
                    Doesn't matter how hard I try<br>
                    Half the words don't mean a thing<br>
                    <br>
                    And I know that I won't be satisfied<br>
                    So why try ignoring him?<br>
                    Make it a dirt dance floor again<br>
                    Say your prayers and stomp it out<br>
                    When they bring that chorus in<br>
                    <br>
                    I bleed it out<br>
                    Digging deeper just to throw it away<br>
                    I bleed it out<br>
                    Digging deeper just to throw it away<br>
                    I bleed it out<br>
                    Digging deeper just to throw it away<br>
                    Just to throw it away<br>
                    Just to throw it away<br>
                    <br>
                    I bleed it out<br>
                    I've opened up these scars<br>
                    I'll make you face this<br>
                    I've pulled myself so far<br>
                    I'll make you face this now<br>
                    I bleed it out<br>
                    Digging deeper just to throw it away<br>
                    I bleed it out<br>
                    Digging deeper just to throw it away<br>
                    I bleed it out<br>
                    Digging deeper just to throw it away<br>
                    Just to throw it away<br>
                    Just to throw it away<br>
                    <br>
                    I bleed it out<br>
                    Digging deeper just to throw it away<br>
                    I bleed it out<br>
                    Digging deeper just to throw it away<br>
                    I bleed it out<br>
                    Digging deeper just to throw it away<br>
                    Just to throw it away<br>
                    Just to throw it away<br>
                    I bleed it out<br>
                    I bleed it out<br>
                    I bleed it out<br>

                    Lyrics:<br>
                    <br>
                    I'm tired of being what you want me to be<br>
                    Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface<br>
                    Don't know what you're expecting of me<br>
                    Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes<br>
                    (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)<br>
                    Every step that I take is another mistake to you<br>
                    (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)<br>
                    <br>
                    I've become so numb, I can't feel you there<br>
                    Become so tired, so much more aware<br>
                    I'm becoming this, all I want to do<br>
                    Is be more like me and be less like you<br>
                    <br>
                    Can't you see that you're smothering me<br>
                    Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?<br>
                    'Cause everything that you thought I would be<br>
                    Has fallen apart right in front of you<br>
                    (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)<br>
                    Every step that I take is another mistake to you<br>
                    (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)<br>
                    And every second I waste is more than I can take<br>
                    <br>
                    I've become so numb, I can't feel you there<br>
                    Become so tired, so much more aware<br>
                    I'm becoming this, all I want to do<br>
                    Is be more like me and be less like you<br>
                    <br>
                    And I know<br>
                    I may end up failing too<br>
                    But I know<br>
                    You were just like me with someone disappointed in you<br>
                    <br>
                    I've become so numb, I can't feel you there<br>
                    Become so tired, so much more aware<br>
                    I'm becoming this, all I want to do<br>
                    Is be more like me and be less like you<br>
                    <br>
                    I've become so numb, I can't feel you there<br>
                    (I'm tired of being what you want me to be)<br>
                    I've become so numb, I can't feel you there<br>
                    (I'm tired of being what you want me to be)<br>
